            <h2>There are many ways to prepare for CS</h2>
            <p>We would recommend that you check out w3 schools. They have many great tutorials
                on coding that are easy to learn and will actually be used in your classes.

            <p>If you would like a recommendation for a language to learn before classes start,
                C++ is going to be an excellet first choice. Its what you will learn in Programming 1 and 2.
                Knowledge of this beforehand will help you excell in your classes.

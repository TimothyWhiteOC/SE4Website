        <h1>What do Computer Science Majors do?</h1>
        <h2>Possible major focuses</h2>
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
		<p>Some CS majors choose not to have any emphasis and study computer science generically. In this path, you can choose to take electives from other paths and get a broader base of knowledge or go in more depth on the pure computer science. If you choose this path, you can expect to take slightly more math courses than other CS majors. This path is best suited for CS majors who have no clear specialization or would prefer a broad knowledge base.</p>
		<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
		<p>Some CS majors choose to focus on the software engineering side of computer science. Software engineering refers to the process of designing and implementing large software systems. In this path, you will learn more about the large-scale problem solving involved in creating software and less about the technical side of programming and understanding how computers work. If you choose this path, you can expect to spend time writing documents for requirements and design. This path is best suited for CS majors who enjoy the problem solving aspects but are less confident with writing code and may also be useful for managers and team leaders.</p>

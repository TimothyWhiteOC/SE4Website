      <p class ="generalDark">
        &emsp;Computer science is the art of communication through logic. It is <br>
        &emsp;about understanding how to make a logical machine do what you desire,<br>
        &emsp;and often times involves enabling the machine to communicate with an <br>
        &emsp;end user. This is accomplished through the use of various programming <br>
        &emsp;languages, and using a corresponding compiler to translate the written,<br>
        &emsp;, human readable "code" into electrical pulses. These pulses are read<br>
        &emsp;by humans as a sequence of ones and zeros, referred to as binary. <br>
        &emsp;These electrical signals can be transferred, recorded, interpreted, <br>
        &emsp;edited, and operated on by cicrutry and mechanisms in the computer. <br>
        &emsp;This includes handling data (numbers and letters) or reading and <br>
        &emsp;ennacting instructions and operations from a computer's instruction set.<br>
        &emsp;These instructions are the opposite binary counterpart of the code, <br>
        &emsp;and sequences of them make up the logic that drives the computer and its<br> 
        &emsp;applications. These instructions thereby determine how end users <br>
        &emsp;interact with there machines.<br>

          &emsp;Computer science is a rising industry that constantly requires a new<br> 
          &emsp;influx of talent. Between its wealth of career paths (including <br>
          &emsp;application development, cybersecurity, and game development), its <br>
          &emsp;pay, and its intrinsic interest. Computer science may well be the<br>

      <p class = "generalDark">
        &emsp;Computer Science is a relatively rigorous course of study. You'll <br>
        &emsp;need to learn to program in various laguages, and to understand <br>
        &emsp;the core logic that transcends these languages. You'll also learn<br>
        &emsp; different tools tied to your specialization. Another key aspect <br>
        &emsp;of CS is understanding development practices, including the <br>
        &emsp;development cycle and team coordination.<br>

      <p class = "generalLight">
        &emsp;Computer Science is extremely versatile, as the needs of computer<br>
        &emsp;users are many. This leads the creation of many roles,<br>
        &emsp;specializations, and fields within computer science. These include<br>
        &emsp;cybersecurity, game development, database management, and application<br>
        &emsp;developemnt. Furthermore, entirely different sorts of projects will<br>
        &emsp;require same base roles, leading to versatility in what a programmer<br>
        &emsp;can develop.

      <p class = "generalDark">
        &emsp;Teach yourself a programming language. Practice team work. Look into<br>
        &emsp;the development cycle. Learn additional relevant programs (Blender or<br>
        &emsp;Unity for Gaming and Animation students, for example). Develop good <br>
        &emsp;study habits, and a good work ethic.

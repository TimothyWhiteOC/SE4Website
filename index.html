      <p class ="section">
        Computer science is the art of communication through logic.
        It is about understanding how to make a logical machine do what you desire,
        and often times involves enabling the machine to communicate with an end user.
        This is accomplished through the use of various programming languages, and
        using a corresponding compiler to translate the written, human readable "code"
        into electrical pulses. These pulses are read by humans as a sequence of ones and
        zeros, referred to as binary. These electrical signals can be transferred, recorded, interpreted, edited,
        and operated on by cicrutry and mechanisms in the computer. This includes handling data
        (numbers and letters) or reading and ennacting instructions and operations from a computer's instruction set.
        These instructions are the opposite binary counterpart of the code, and sequences of them make up the logic
        that drives the computer and its applications. These instructions thereby determine how end users interact with there machines.

        <p class = "section">
          Computer science is a rising industry that constantly requires a new influx of talent.
          Between its wealth of career paths (including application development, cybersecurity, 
          and game development), its pay, and its intrinsic interest. Computer science may well be the major for you.

      <p class = "section">
        Computer Science is a relatively rigorous course of study. You'll need to learn to program in various laguages,
        and to understand the core logic that transcends these languages. You'll also learn different tools tied to your specialization.
        Another key aspect of CS is understanding development practices, including the development cycle and team coordination.

        Computer Science is extremely versatile, as the needs of computer users are many. This leads the creation of many roles,
        specializations, and fields within computer science. These include cybersecurity, game development, database management, 
        and application dvelopemnt. Furthermore, entirely different sorts of projects will require same base
        roles, leading to versatility in what a programmer can develop.

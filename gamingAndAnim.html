                This set of entertainment-focused specializations brings art, storytelling, and interaction to the forefront.
                Without these programmers, animators and game development teams would be unable to realize their vision. Furthermore,
                these programmers may be able to play a role in making some design decisions, depending on their integration into the team.
                Due to the artistic nature of game development, more versatility is embedded into a Computer Science with
                Gaming and Animation degree than a traditional CS degree, if only to better enable communication and teamwork within the industry.
                In addition to the generalized skillset, these programmers are expected to be able to communicate with artists and
                game designers, and to understand the flow of art and game production. Furthermore, CS w/ G&A majors should expect to
                study game-development specific tools, namely the game engines Unity and Unreal and 3d modeling programs like Blender.
